# EasyU Android Application

## Purpose: 
Depending on user's input of SAT test or ACT test score, search for the universities that user has higher score than lower 25 percent of the students enrolled (etc. In UCSD, for all the students enrolled who took SAT test, the lower 25 percent of them has an average score 1500, if user has totoal score of 1600, than the university will be showed).
And then give user's choice of sorting the university list by ranking, or lower test score to high score, high to low.

## Result:
Show a list of universities user should apply to.

## Algorithm:
updated later, in progress



## To Be Updated:
- Give user choice of state.
- Put sort option in the Settings UI instead of Search UI
- Put sort default to college ranking 
- Added home page UI with two buttons for SAT or ACT.
